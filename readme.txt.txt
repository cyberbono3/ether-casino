We are going to create a casino like application where users are able 
to bet money for a number between 1 and 10 and if theyï¿½re correct, 
they win a portion of all the ether money staked after 100 total bets.


So we have to do the following tasks:

Keep a record of how much a user has bet for what number.
The minimum price of a bet.
The total amount of ether accomulated.
A variable to store how many bets there are.
When to stop the bets and reveal the winning number.
A function to send the winning amount of ether for each winner


These are the functions:

Bet for a number.
Generate random number as winner.
Send ether to winners.
